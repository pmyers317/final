Goal: Create a readable and simple to use website

Feedback Questions: Can you tell what all the different functions of the website are.

Hypothesis: With the simple old website design, a user will easily be able to tell how to use my website

Accept or reject your hypothesis?

Accept

Feedback I applied to my site: 

1. Cluttered center

2. Bootstrap to fit to screen

3. Font size (larger)

I did not document every change that I made to the original source code, but everything outside of the home page and the navbar are my design. On the main page, I changed text and images, as well as adding the rotating image banner and cutting out one of the sections in the middle to make it more visually appealing.
